Thank you for choosing to modify an existing PRONOM entry. For each submission, please include as much of the following information as possible. It's okay if you don't have everything, but please include what you can.

**Affected format(s)**
List the format PUID that is affected, include the URL for the record if desired, e.g. `http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt/{no}` for standard PUIDs or `http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/x-fmt/{no}` for X-PUIDS.



**Details of change**
Information about the change you'd like to see made to the record.


**Additional information**
Information that is always welcome.

* Format name - Use the official name where known. Please capitalise each word unless the format name is stylised in some alternative way, e.g. Apple iBook.
* Version number (where relevant)
* PUID - if it exists already and you're providing an enhanced description.
* Extensions - any extensions known to be associated with the format.
* MIME/Media Type - the MIME or Media Type associated with the format. A brief description of what a MIME type is can be found here. This should be an official Media Type, either registered and listed via the IANA or listed in official format documentation produced by the vendor. The best way to search IANA is to find in page and search for key words of the format.
* Description - a concise, objective description of the file format.
* Format type - What type of format is it (see below)?
* Vendor - (if known) - which vendor created the format? Which vendor currently supports it?
* File format identification signatures - (for the brave!).
